    <h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
    <h2>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
    
    <p><i>Alice</i> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of
    having nothing to do: <strong> or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was
    reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it</strong>, <q>and what is the use of a
    book,</q> thought Alice <q>without pictures or conversations?</p>
    
    <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made 
    her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain
    would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a
    White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
    
    <p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much
    out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, <q>Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!</q>
    (she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have
    wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit 
    actually <em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried 
    on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
    before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it,
    and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just
    in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
