        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 ½ or 3 cups flour</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
          <li>¾ teaspoons baking soda</li>
          <li> ¼ teaspoons salt</li>
          <li> ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
          <li>1 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
          <li>1 cup unsalted butter, room temp.</li>
          <li> 1 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>¾ cup light brown sugar</li>
          <li>2 large eggs & 1 egg yolk, room temp.</li>
          <li>3 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
          <li>3 & ½ tablespoons bourbon or whiskey</li>
          <li>1 & ½ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, extra for decorating</li>
          <li>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate, roughly chopped into chunks</li>
          <li>1 cup mini pretzels, roughly chopped</li>
          <li>Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
          <li>In a large bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
          <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat peanut butter and butter until smooth.
          <li>Gradually add in both sugars, one at a time, and beat until well combined, about 2 minutes.
          <li>On low speed, add in the eggs and egg yolk, one at a time, beating well after each addition, and scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla and bourbon.
          <li>Gradually add in the dry ingredients, beating on low speed until just combined. Turn the mixer off.
          <li>Using a rubber spatula, fold in the chocolate chips and chocolate chunks.
          <li>Using a large cookie scoop, scoop out ¼ cup portions of the cookie dough and roll it into balls. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 2-inches between each cookie for spreading.
          <li>Gently press pretzel pieces down on top of each cookie ball, slightly flattening the ball. This will help them spread evenly in the oven.
          <li>Bake, one tray at a time, for 14 to 16 minutes, or until golden brown and set. Repeat with all cookie dough.
          <li>When the cookies come out of the oven, press a few extra chocolate chips and/ or chocolate chunks on top while they’re still warm, and sprinkle with sea salt, if desired.
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>If you're not using a digital scale to weigh your ingredients, you may want to reduce the <br> 
            flour to 2 and 1/2 cups. Fluff up your flour first, then gently spoon it into the measuring cup <br>
            and level it off with a knife. But for best results, weigh your ingredients.</li>
           <li>Do not use natural peanut butter for this recipe. I recommend a regular creamy peanut butter like JIF or Skippy.</li>
           <li>I have not tested this recipe with crunchy peanut butter and do not know how it will work.</li>
        </ul>
